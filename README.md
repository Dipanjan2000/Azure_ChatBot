# Project_Azure_ChatBot
Hello, I'm Dipanjan Chatterjee. I'm presenting my website, which I created for the TCS Sirius Program. In this website I built an interactive chatbot that can tell the name of the capital of any country in the globe. With the assistance of Microsoft Azure services, I created this chatbot. The thorough discussion of this project is done below.

### AzureBot_SecretKeys
The chatbot used in the website is working with the help of the secret keys as we can see in the screenshot below. The secret key is used in the embedded code and the embedded code must be pasted in the HTML code.

### Knowledge_Base
In order to make the chatbot knowledgable about the capitals of different countries around the world we can use Knowledge Bases. Knowledge Bases help us to give the chat bot insights about what to answer.

As we can see, from the screen shot below knowledge bases are in the form of question and answers. We can also add QnA pair in these knowledge bases in order to enhance and maximise the knowledge of the bot.
